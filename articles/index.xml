      <description>On the 4th of June we hosted the NodeJS June Meetup in our CreatePlayground office, with 3 presentations and ongoing discussions about various topics.
The first talk with the title Private registry with Verdaccio was given by Juan Picado, follwed by a Lightning Talk about Fun with Time Zones by our Gottfried Chen. The last talk was held by Juho Vepsäläinen about JavaScript - Quo Vadis
Related questions and notes about the talks as well as conversations about other NodeJS related topics have been discussed afterwards and we are already looking forward to host the next one.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our apps, we use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/mvvm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)&lt;/a&gt; approach.
This concept manages the interaction within a view controller, but who manages the view controllers?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Android Jetpack Navigation Pitfalls &amp; Tricks</title>

      <description>Table of content  Send Args to fragments within activities Use startActivityForResult with the Navigation library Use generic naming for action names Reuse fragments in multiple navigation graphs TLDR Further readings  Navigation library from Jetpack offers a great variety of helpful tools, especially with the SafeArgs extension. My last project contained many different navigation flows paired with a large number of screens, so I decided to try the new navigation library which had just reached a stable release.</description>

      <title>Fun With Time Zones Part 1</title>

      <description>In our daily jobs as programmers we tackle coding challenges and abstract them in algorithms and functions, happy when we find an elegant solutions to a tricky problem. We find comfort in dealing with easily understandable, deterministic and logical concepts.
Time is NOT one of them. And that’s a big problem. We are so used logical terms, that we try to apply our thinking to the concept of time as well.</description>

      <title>Reactive Swift: Progress HUD Extension and Order of Events</title>
      <link>https://code.allaboutapps.at/articles/reactive-swift-events-order/</link>

      <description>A blocking progress HUD to show a network or any other asynchronous activity may not be the most elegant solution, but sometimes it just gets the job done. Using ReactiveSwift you can use a SignalProducer extension to quickly show &amp;amp; hide a HUD for any reactive operation:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  extension SignalProducer { public func bindToProgressHUD(_ viewDelay: Double = 0.</description>

      <description>Last Thursday we hosted the 109th edition of Cocoaheads Austria in our office and more than 30 local iOS and Mac developers showed up. Cocoaheads is a monthly meetup and always hosted at a different location, usually by local development companies here in Vienna.
Michael Heinzl and myself, Matthias Buchetics, gave the main talk about App Architecture at all about apps before Peter Steinberger talked about Swizzling. Our own Gunter Hager then closed with a fun presentation of Emoji Flags before we had some great conversations with food &amp;amp; drinks.</description>

      <title>Advanced Pagination With Epoxy &amp; Datasources</title>

      <description>Many developers still avoid using Epoxy. I even hesitated for a long time because of the boilerplate coming a long with epoxy and its models, but after reading this post at the latest, you may consider using epoxy, when paging is needed.
So in this post we gonna build pagination with the jetpack‘s paging library, and epoxy, which has an own controller for paging.
We gonna use reddit as our api, by simply adding .</description>

      <title>Emoji Flags</title>
      <link>https://code.allaboutapps.at/articles/emoji-flags/</link>

      <description>Sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s the need to fly a flag in your project. You probably know the ISO code, more specifically the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, a.k.a two-letter code. For Austria this would be AT. Now when thinking about converting these codes into emoji flags, a lookup table comes to mind. But instead of jumping straight into implementing the table it&amp;rsquo;s time to take a closer look at the Unicode Standard. The clever people that added the flag emojis to the Unicode character set invented a system of specifying the flags that makes an algorithmic conversion without lookup tables quite easy.</description>

      <title>Drawing Smooth 2D Graphs using UIBezierPath</title>
      <link>https://code.allaboutapps.at/articles/smooth-graph-lines/</link>

      <description>We have been working on multiple projects that required drawing 2D line graphs given a set of points. UIKit gives us the versatile UIBezierPath, which allows us to create a straight line graph by appending segments using addLineToPath for each point in our array. Easy, but not really pretty.
There are two different kinds of curves in UIBezierPath: quadratic curves with a single control point (addQuadCurveToPoint) and cubic curves with two control points (addCurveToPoint).</description>

      <title>TimingLogger</title>

      <description>TimingLogger Sometimes developers needs to analyze performance of a small friction of code. Maybe a RecyclerView is not scrolling smoothly or a calculation needs too much time, we have to split it up and try to find the line or block that runs inefficently. We all know to get a smooth user experience we only have 16ms for each frame to render. So it is very important to locate and optimize inefficient code.</description>

      <description>Team Android Project Template As a software development company we are starting new projects every few weeks. With every project we create a jira ticket called Project Setup.
We walked through all our Project Setup Jira tickets and calculated the average hours for this kind of task: In average every android project needs about 3.5 hours for a simple setup. On the other hand the project setup is boring and no developer likes that work.</description>

      <title>Reactive Swift: Access Control for Mutable Properties</title>
      <link>https://code.allaboutapps.at/articles/reactive-swift-properties/</link>

      <description>Swift&amp;rsquo;s access control allows us to define separate access levels for the getter and setter of a property. This is nice if we want to provide read access to a property but should only be able to modify it internally:
private(set) var isLoading = false When using ReactiveSwift (or similarly RxSwift) you usually work with MutableProperty. In order to limit modification of the property&amp;rsquo;s value we can create a private writable MutableProperty and a public read-only Property:</description>

      <title>Reactive Swift: flatMap, flatten and combineLatest</title>
      <link>https://code.allaboutapps.at/articles/reactive-swift-flatmap/</link>

      <guid>https://code.allaboutapps.at/articles/reactive-swift-flatmap/</guid>
      <description>Most of our projects at all about apps are build using a MVVM architecture with ReactiveSwift as our reactive framework of choice. However, all code examples should be easily translatable to RxSwift.
Often, you end up with an array of objects (e.g. View Models) which contain some reactive property that you want to bind to. The array itself is a MutableProperty as well and can change at any time (e.g. after a network request).</description>
