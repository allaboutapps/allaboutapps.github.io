      <description>On the 4th of June we hosted the NodeJS June Meetup in our CreatePlayground office, with 3 presentations and ongoing discussions about various topics.
The first talk with the title Private registry with Verdaccio was given by Juan Picado, follwed by a Lightning Talk about Fun with Time Zones by our Gottfried Chen. The last talk was held by Juho Vepsäläinen about JavaScript - Quo Vadis
Related questions and notes about the talks as well as conversations about other NodeJS related topics have been discussed afterwards and we are already looking forward to host the next one.</description>

      <description>In our daily jobs as programmers we tackle coding challenges and abstract them in algorithms and functions, happy when we find an elegant solutions to a tricky problem. We find comfort in dealing with easily understandable, deterministic and logical concepts.
Time is NOT one of them. And that’s a big problem. We are so used logical terms, that we try to apply our thinking to the concept of time as well.</description>
