      <description>TimingLogger Sometimes developers needs to analyze performance of a small friction of code. Maybe a RecyclerView is not scrolling smoothly or a calculation needs too much time, we have to split it up and try to find the line or block that runs inefficently. We all know to get a smooth user experience we only have 16ms for each frame to render. So it is very important to locate and optimize inefficient code.</description>

      <description>Team Android Project Template As a software development company we are starting new projects every few weeks. With every project we create a jira ticket called Project Setup.
We walked through all our Project Setup Jira tickets and calculated the average hours for this kind of task: In average every android project needs about 3.5 hours for a simple setup. On the other hand the project setup is boring and no developer likes that work.</description>
